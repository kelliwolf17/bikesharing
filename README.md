# bikesharing

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to take Citibike public data from New York City and create visualizations in order to convince investors that a similar program could work in Des Moines. A dashboard was created of this data using Tableau Public.

You can view the dashboard [here.](https://public.tableau.com/views/Bikesharing_Challenge_16115180203740/Story1?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link)

# Results - Dashboard Story
## Checkout Times
From the two plots on the first slide of the story, you will see Checkout Times for Users and Checkout Times by Gender. From these visualizations we can determine that most trips last between 3-8 hours long. To dive deeper into what this means, we also split this same data up by the gender of the user. Male riders generally use the bike-sharing program more than females and use the bikes for longer spans of time.

## Trips by Weekday per Hour
The next slide shows a heat map of the trips taken each weekday broken down by hour. The most trips occur between 6 am to 9 am Monday through Friday and 10 am to 5 pm Saturday and Sunday.

## Trips by Gender per Hour
Breaking down the data further, we can see that men are using the bikes at a much higher frequency than women both during the week and on the weekends.

## User Trips by Gender by Weekday
The next slide shows a breakdown of data by gender, by user type (either customers or subscribers) each day of the week. Generally the male subscribers make up a larger proportion of the users.

## Top Starting and Ending Locations
Then we tried to determine where the bikes were being used the most in New York City. Manhattan seems to be a "hot spot" for bike usage as opposed to the other burrows.

# Summary
Based on this analysis, it can be determined that:
- male riders use the bikesharing program more frequently than females
- bikes are used as a means of commuting to work during the week and more for leisure on the weekends
- subscribers to the program utilize the bikes much more than one-time customers
- downtown Des Moines may be a good target to initiate the bikesharing program since it does so well in Manhattan

## Additional Plots
We created a few additional plots to see the target age groups for marketing purposes. It appears that ages 30-50 years old would be the ideal audience. This tells us that putting bikes by officer buildings could be a good location since we determined that the bikes are used to get to and from work. More data from the Des Moines area would need to be surveryed to find the best locations for the stations.
